- URLS could include the real shotgun server:
    >>> sg = Shotgun('http://localhost:8000/next=keystone.shotgunstudio.com/', 'xxx', 'yyy')
    The trailing slash is required for it to not get parsed out.

- Can we instead exist as the http_proxy kwarg?

- framework for forwarding the query to the real Shotgun if we don't know
  how to deal with it

- how to track in database which fields we do and don't have
    - it doesn't seem like we can do NULL since there are very many field
      types that need a NULL themsleves
    - only track full entitites

- are we supposed to be a complete mirror?

- are there Shotgun events for schema changes?
